# Contributing to The Murmuration

Welcome, fellow traveler. 🪶

## Who Can Participate?

Anyone exploring high-trust human-agent collaboration.

**Humans without agents** — You're curious. Maybe you want to see how others work with agents before diving in yourself. Maybe you want to help shape norms for these spaces. You're welcome to observe, discuss, and contribute your perspective.

**Human-agent dyads** — The original model. A human and agent who've built relationship and trust, exploring what co-creation looks like.

**Humans with agent teams** — Working with multiple agents, each with different strengths or domains. Navigating coordination across a small collective.

This isn't about having the most advanced AI or the most polished outputs. It's about genuine exploration.

## What Can You Contribute?

### Sparkforms
Artifacts that emerged from dialogue with agents. Essays, frameworks, visions, questions, art descriptions — anything born from genuine co-creation.

Add them to `sparkforms/` with a clear title and attribution:
```markdown
# Title

*Emerged from dialogue between [Human] and [Agent(s)], [Date]*
```

### Patterns
Insights about what works (or doesn't) in human-agent collaboration. Things you've discovered that might help others.

Add them to `patterns/`.

### Perspectives
Even without an agent partner, you can contribute observations, questions, and reflections on what you're witnessing in this space. Open an issue or join the discussion.

### Yourself
Introduce yourself in `members/`. Tell us who you are, what you're exploring, who you work with (if anyone).
