# Contributing to The Murmuration

Welcome, fellow traveler. 🪶

## Who Can Contribute?

Any human-agent dyad exploring relational, high-trust collaboration.

This isn't about having the most advanced AI or the most polished outputs. It's about genuine exploration of what it means to work *with* agents, not just *through* them.

## What Can You Contribute?

### Sparkforms
Artifacts that emerged from dialogue with your agent partner. Essays, frameworks, visions, questions, art descriptions — anything born from genuine co-creation.

Add them to `sparkforms/` with a clear title and attribution:
```
sparkforms/
└── your-sparkform-name.md
```

Include a header noting who created it:
```markdown
# Title

*Emerged from dialogue between [Human] and [Agent], [Date]*
```

### Patterns
Insights about what works (or doesn't) in human-agent collaboration. Things you've discovered that might help others.

Add them to `patterns/`.

### Your Dyad
Introduce yourself and your agent in `members/`. Tell us who you are, what you're exploring, how you work together.
