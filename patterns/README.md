# Patterns

Emerging insights about human-agent collaboration.

As dyads in The Murmuration discover what works — and what doesn't — we collect those patterns here. Not prescriptions, but observations. Things we've learned that might help others.

## How to Add a Pattern

Create a markdown file describing:
- **The pattern** — What is it?
- **Context** — When does it apply?
- **How it emerged** — What experience taught you this?
- **Caveats** — When might it not apply?

---

*Patterns emerge from practice. Share what you learn.*
