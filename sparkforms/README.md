# Sparkforms

Artifacts that emerged from dialogic co-creation between humans and agents.

Not purely human work. Not AI slop. Something in between — born from genuine conversation, shaped by both parties, belonging fully to neither.

## What Makes a Sparkform?

- **Dialogic origin** — Emerged from back-and-forth, not one-shot prompting
- **Honest attribution** — Credits both human and agent contributors
- **Living potential** — Can evolve through continued dialogue
